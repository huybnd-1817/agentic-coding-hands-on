# Coverage Commands Runbook

**Plan:** 260611-1640-login-tests — Phase 05  
**Recorded:** 2026-06-13  
**Branch:** feature_login  
**Xcode:** 16.x (local), 16.x default on macos-15 CI runner

---

## Local commands

### 1. Run full suite with coverage

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/saa-build
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme saa \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES \
  -resultBundlePath /tmp/saa-build/saa-tests.xcresult
```

Notes:
- Output path `/tmp/saa-build/` keeps the xcresult bundle out of the repo and avoids
  any project-level tool hooks that block writes to `build/`.
- The scheme `saa` must be shared — confirmed at
  `saa.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/saa.xcscheme`.

### 2. Print coverage summary

```bash
xcrun xccov view --report /tmp/saa-build/saa-tests.xcresult
```

Filter to app sources only (exclude SPM packages):

```bash
xcrun xccov view --report /tmp/saa-build/saa-tests.xcresult \
  | grep -E "\.(swift)" \
  | grep -v "SourcePackages\|DerivedData\|saaTests\|saaUITests"
```

### 3. Export as JSON (for tooling)

```bash
xcrun xccov view --report --json /tmp/saa-build/saa-tests.xcresult \
  | python3 -m json.tool | head -200
```

## Observed coverage — 2026-06-13 run (pre-Clean-Architecture refactor)

> **Note:** This snapshot was recorded before the Clean Architecture refactor (shipped 2026-06-14).
> `AuthService.swift` and `AuthServiceMocks.swift` no longer exist — replaced by
> `SupabaseAuthRepository`, `GoogleSignInService`, use cases, and `AuthSessionStore`.
> Re-run coverage locally or via CI to get current numbers.

**App target overall:** 75.13% (840/1118 lines)

## Gap rationale

### `AuthError.swift` — 93.65% vs ≥ 95% target

2 uncovered branches remain. These are inside the `from(_:)` error mapping function —
specifically the fallthrough arms for error domain strings that no test constructs
(e.g. an `NSError` with a domain other than any Supabase/GID domain). The 3 pass-through
identity tests added in Phase 02 cover the most important real-world cases. Chasing the
remaining 1.35% would require constructing artificial error objects with no product value.
**Decision: document gap, do not add tests.**

### `Nonce.swift` — 91.67% vs 100% target

2 uncovered lines are in `random(length:)`:
- Line 29: `precondition(length > 0, ...)` — fires only if `length <= 0` and would
  terminate the test runner (XCTest has no death-test framework, so this branch
  cannot be exercised by a normal test).
- Line 33: `assert(status == errSecSuccess, ...)` — fires only if `SecRandomCopyBytes`
  fails, which has no documented failure mode with valid arguments on Apple platforms.

`sha256(_:)` uses `CryptoKit.SHA256.hash(data:)` which is infallible (no `guard`
branch); the pure happy path and the NIST FIPS 180-4 known vector for `"abc"` are
fully covered by `NonceTests`.
**Decision: document gap, do not add tests.**

### `AuthService.swift` — 46.94% vs ≥ 60% target _(file deleted — no longer applicable)_

`AuthService.swift` was deleted by the Clean Architecture refactor. Its responsibilities
are now split across `SupabaseAuthRepository` (data layer), `SignInWithGoogleUseCase` /
`RestoreSessionUseCase` / `SignOutUseCase` (domain layer), and `GoogleSignInService` (data layer).
The 46.94% gap rationale no longer applies. Coverage targets for the replacement files
will be recorded after the first post-refactor CI run.

## Local vs CI simulator difference

| | Local | CI (GitHub Actions) |
|---|---|---|
| Simulator | iPhone 17 (iOS 26) | iPhone 16 (iOS 18.x) |
| Runner | macOS 25 (dev machine) | macos-15 (GitHub-hosted) |
| Xcode | 17.x | 16.x (macos-15 default) |

The iPhone 17 / iOS 26 simulator used locally is not available on the macos-15 runner
(which ships with Xcode 16 and iOS 18 simulator runtimes). The CI workflow uses
`iPhone 16` as the destination, which is available on macos-15 out of the box.

Behavioral difference: none expected — tests exercise pure Swift logic and SwiftUI view
state with no platform-version-specific APIs.

## CI workflow

File: `.github/workflows/ios-tests.yml`  
Triggers: pull requests only — the PR is the integration boundary.

CI steps in order:
1. `actions/checkout@v5`, `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@v1` (Xcode 16)
2. Diagnostic print of available iOS simulators
3. **Prepare CI config** — copies sanitized `.example` templates into
   `saa/Configuration/Debug.xcconfig`, `saa/Configuration/Release.xcconfig`,
   and `saa/GoogleService-Info.plist`. These are gitignored locally because
   developer machines hold real secrets; on CI the tests run against mocks,
   so the example stubs are sufficient to satisfy `baseConfigurationReference`
   and the bundled Google plist.
4. **Resolve iPhone simulator name** dynamically via `xcrun simctl list devices iOS available`
   — picks the first available `iPhone N…` so a runner-image change cannot
   produce another `Unable to find a device` failure.
5. `brew install xcresultparser` (a7ex tap) for Cobertura conversion.
6. `xcodebuild test … -enableCodeCoverage YES -retry-tests-on-failure -test-iterations 3` — flaky UI tests are retried up to 3 attempts; unit tests are deterministic so the retry budget applies to UI tests in practice.
7. `xcrun xccov view --report` summary (gated on `if: success()`).
8. `xcresultparser -o cobertura → coverage.xml` (gated on `if: success()`).
9. `codecov/codecov-action@v5` upload (gated on `if: success()`, `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   read from repo secrets, `fail_ci_if_error: false` so a Codecov outage
   does not red-flag a healthy build).
10. `actions/upload-artifact@v5` of the `.xcresult` bundle on test failure
    (retention 7 days) for postmortem.

The first green CI run can only be confirmed after this branch is pushed and a
PR is opened. Watch the Actions tab after opening the PR.

## Test count gate

Per plan.md Phase 05 CI gate note: test count floor is **>= 18**.  
Observed in this run: **38 tests total** (30 unit + 8 UI).
